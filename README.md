Key excerpts: I think consciousness is a summary of previous experiences, which may be related to magnetic fields and higher levels. In other words, we should now find out how experiences are stored in neurons. Consciousness may be a basic attribute that I guessed ahead. When our neurons successfully store experiences, consciousness appears. Consciousness is the result of experiences stored in neurons.
So my theory agrees with the meaning of field or higher level generation. The current feelings are also generated by field or higher level. Tens of thousands of neurons store countless experiences. When we see the text on the screen now, it will be accompanied by changes in field or higher level. This is the current consciousness. Unconscious memory is also the change of field by different receptors in the body.
